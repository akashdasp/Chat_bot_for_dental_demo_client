        "What We Believe\n \nThe mark-up on dental equipment and supplies is unfair. And you should never have to cross your fingers and hope that an item you need will be available when you’ve run out.\n\nIn a perfect world, you would have a sales rep who can anticipate when you’re going to run out of something so that it appears at your office before you have a chance to order it. That might sound like a fantasy, but that’s life with Frontier. Because we believe our customers are worth the effort. And we always go the extra smile.\n\nAt Frontier, you order via our user-friendly online store, or call up your rep, ask for the product you need, and we’ll ship it that same day. Existing customers have 30 days to pay and if you ordered the wrong thing, we’ll send you the right one. Satisfaction guaranteed.\n\nWe value our team members, and we appreciate your business.\nWelcome to the new Frontier in dental supplies.",
        "Buying dental supplies should be easier than pulling teeth\n \nSince early beginnings in 2016, Frontier Dental has been dedicated to providing a new customer experience in the dental supply industry, built on service and customer centricity.\n\nWe are different from other competitors in the market. You’re not just a number at Frontier Dental - your experience as a customer is what we are passionate about and is why we will always go the extra smile to ensure your complete satisfaction and happiness.",
        "You’re In Good Hands\n \nAt Frontier, you’ll always get the best deal on dental supplies—that’s probably how we’ll win your business. But overall customer experience is how we’ll earn your loyalty. For instance, with us, you’ll have a dedicated sales rep. One point of contact, knowledgeable in the dental industry (most of our reps have worked as dental professionals and know their labials from their linguals), who you’ll speak to every time you need something. They’ll get to know your needs, your dog’s name, and they’ll happily answer your questions while providing recommendations and advice based on your situation and your budget"
